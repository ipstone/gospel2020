In these times of turbulence and uncertainty, it is good to know that Godâ€™s love for each of us is a sure thing and that His love is of the most noble kind.  Much of our understanding of love comes from what Jesus taught and demonstrated when He was here on earth 2,000 years ago.

 
Even while many are celebrating the birth of Jesus in this holiday season, we will take some time to consider the good news about the love of God that Jesus taught us and showed us.


Humanly speaking, it is NOT in us to always have peace in the midst of the storm.  Many little episodes in our regular existence, let alone during this unprecedented crisis, attest to our vulnerability and restlessness.
