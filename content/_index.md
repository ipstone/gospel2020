<p style='color:maroon'> The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.     1 Timothy 1:5 (ESV) <BR> </p>
<p style='color:#1F45FC'>
In these turbulent times, especially since early 2020, we find ourselves yearning for the things that are dependable and sure for ourselves and the people we love.  In our meeting on July 10, 2021, we will take a look at how Love and a Good Conscience are the building blocks of civilization and of our lives personally. Whether we know it or not, they play a vital role in our relationship with the God who created all of us.
