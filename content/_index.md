<p style='color:maroon'> The eternal God is a dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms … Deuteronomy 33:27a <BR> </p>

<p style='color:#1F45FC; text-align:left; '>* Home is more than a saying on a souvenir plaque <br>
* Home is a fundamental human longing for acceptance, openness, and love <br>
* As spiritual beings God was meant to be part of our Home <br>
* Home is a deeper dimension of our lives designed by a God of Love <br>
* Present yearnings for home today reveal some sense of loss in past history when Paradise was lost <br>
* Selfish pride bore the poison fruit of broken human ties and alienation <br>
* But our God of Love has not left us with no way Home <br>
* The Son of God left Home to bring us back to His Father’s House  <br>
* He is a dwelling place for those who believe <br> 
* Jesus’ sacrifice secured for us the Home our first ancestors once enjoyed in God’s presence <br>
* Fully reconciled to God by His death on a cross, anyone who believes in Jesus as the way back Home can enjoy peace, communion with God and that elusive feeling of being at home with family and friends  <br>
