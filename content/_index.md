header_subheadline: "
<p style='color:darkblue'> The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.     1 Timothy 1:5 (ESV) <BR> </p>
<p style='color:maroon'>
In these turbulent times, especially since early 2020, we find ourselves yearning for the things that are dependable and sure for ourselves and the people we love.  In the meeting we have planned for July 10, 2021, we will take a look at how Love and a Good Conscience are the building blocks of civilization and of our lives personally. Whether we know it or not, they play a vital role in our relationship with the God who created all of us.

<br>
Please come join us on-line to consider this topic together.  Our meeting will be held in Zoom starting at 7:30 pm on July 10th, with some music and sharing, for about 30 minutes.  Then, any who would like to participate directly in more discussion on the topic can stay on in that Zoom session for another 30 minutes.
