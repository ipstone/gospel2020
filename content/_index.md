<p style='color:maroon'> The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.     1 Timothy 1:5 (ESV) <BR> </p>
<p style='color:#1F45FC'>
In these turbulent times, especially since early 2020, we find ourselves yearning for the things that are dependable and sure for ourselves and the people we love.  In our meeting July 10, 2021, we will take a look at how a Good Conscience is a critical building block of civilization and of our lives personally. Whether we realize it or not, our conscience plays a vital role in our relationship with the God who created all of us.
